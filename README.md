# CFMAR Lab - Neural Nets for American Option Pricing


These files are used to price Bermudan options (discrete time steps), which, when given enough time steps, can be used to approximate American options. 

The folder "tf" contains the neural network architecture for various options in Tensorflow. The folder "torch" is in-progress; we are working to switch the code from Tensoflow to PyTorch to see if there is a change in price. The files under "torch" currently do not run without error.
